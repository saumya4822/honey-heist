            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p><strong>Money Heist</strong> (originally known in Spanish as <em>La Casa de Papel</em>) is a gripping
                Spanish heist crime drama television series created by Álex Pina. The show follows two long-prepared,
                meticulously planned heists led by a mysterious mastermind known only as "The Professor".</p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-box">
            <h2>The Premise</h2>
            <p>The series revolves around a group of highly skilled robbers who have nothing left to lose. Recruited by
                The Professor, they take hostages and lock themselves inside Spain's most secure financial institutions.
            </p>
            <p>Unlike traditional bank robbers, their goal in the first heist is not to steal existing money from a
                vault. Instead, they take over the <span class="highlight">Royal Mint of Spain</span> to print €2.4
                billion of entirely new, untraceable currency over the course of several days.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-box">
            <h2>The Mastermind's Golden Rules</h2>
            <p>To ensure the plan goes perfectly, The Professor establishes strict rules for the crew before the heist
                begins:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>No Real Names:</strong> Every member uses the name of a city (e.g., Tokyo, Berlin, Denver)
                    to hide their true identity.</li>
                <li><strong>No Personal Relationships:</strong> Emotional attachments could compromise the highly
                    delicate plan and cloud their judgment.</li>
                <li><strong>No Bloodshed:</strong> The Professor insists that no one, neither hostages nor police, can
                    be killed. They must keep the public on their side to succeed.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="content-box">
            <h2>The Crew (Main Characters)</h2>
            <p>The success of the heist relies on a diverse group of criminals, each bringing a unique skill to the
                table:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The Professor (Sergio Marquina):</strong> The brilliant mastermind who plans the heists down
                    to the exact second and guides the team from the outside.</li>
                <li><strong>Tokyo (Silene Oliveira):</strong> A tough, impulsive robber who serves as the show's
                    narrator. Her unpredictability often complicates the plan.</li>
                <li><strong>Berlin (Andrés de Fonollosa):</strong> The Professor's elegant but sociopathic
                    second-in-command, tasked with leading the crew inside the Mint.</li>
                <li><strong>Nairobi (Ágata Jiménez):</strong> The charismatic quality-control expert in charge of
                    printing the money and managing the hostages with empathy.</li>
                <li><strong>Denver (Daniel Ramos):</strong> A hot-headed young man with a distinct laugh, who joins the
                    heist alongside his father, Moscow.</li>
                <li><strong>Rio (Aníbal Cortés):</strong> The team's young, naive hacker responsible for dealing with
                    the security and alarm systems.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="content-box">
            <h2>Themes and Message</h2>
            <p>More than just a thriller, Money Heist explores themes of resistance, rebellion against the financial
                establishment, and human nature under extreme pressure. The robbers adopt the iconic artist Salvador
                Dalí's mask and the Italian anti-fascist song <em>"Bella Ciao"</em> as symbols of their resistance,
                turning a criminal act into a profound statement against the system.</p>
